NSR in Network Service Mesh 2. Container Registry usage in Kubernetes (if NSR was a misinterpretation) NSR within a Kubernetes Network Service Mesh In the Network Service Mesh (NSM) architecture, the NSR (also referred to as MSR \u2013 Mesh Service Registry ) acts as the central service discovery mechanism . Service Discovery The Kubernetes API server\u2019s etcd is commonly leveraged as the backing store for the registry. It stores information about: Available network services Network Service Endpoints (NSEs) Associated metadata Registration Process NSMgr (Network Service Manager) runs as a control-plane component on each node. Its responsibilities include: Discovering local Network Service Endpoints (NSEs) Registering these NSEs with the NSR via the Kubernetes API server This ensures that all available services and endpoints are visible at the mesh level. Service Consumption A Network Service Client (NSC) , typically a Pod with specific annotations, requests a network service. The workflow is as follows: The local NSMgr receives the service request It queries the NSR (via the API server) for a suitable NSE A virtual wire (connection) is established between: The requesting client The selected Network Service Endpoint This enables dynamic, policy-driven service connectivity across the mesh. General Container Registry Usage in Kubernetes If \u201cNSR\u201d is a typo or misinterpretation and instead refers to the general concept of a container image registry in Kubernetes, the process is different and focuses on image distribution and authentication . Image Pulling The kubelet component on each node is responsible for pulling container images. It uses the configured container runtime, such as: Docker containerd CRI-O Images are pulled from a specified container registry. Authentication (Image Pull Secrets) For private container registries (for example: Docker Hub, AWS ECR, Azure Container Registry, Google Artifact Registry): A Kubernetes Secret of type kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson must be created. This secret stores: Registry endpoint Authentication credentials Linking Secrets to Pods The image pull secret is referenced in the Pod specification. This allows the kubelet to authenticate with the registry and pull the required image. Example usage scenarios include: - Private enterprise registries - Cloud-provider-managed registries - Secured internal image repositories Summary In Network Service Mesh , NSR refers to a service registry used for discovering and connecting network services.
