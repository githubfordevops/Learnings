# 3R Trading Framework
A practical, disciplined approach to planning, executing, and holding 3R trades.

---

## What does 3R mean?

**R = Risk per trade**

- 1R = the amount you are willing to lose on a trade
- 3R = profit equals **3 × risk**

Example:
- Risk (1R) = ₹1,000
- 3R winner = ₹3,000
- 1R loss = −₹1,000

The goal is **not high accuracy**, but **high-quality risk–reward**.

# 1. DAILY 3R TRADE CHECKLIST

> Use this checklist **before every trade**.  
> If even **one item fails → NO TRADE**.

---

## Market & Context
- [ ] Market is trending or clearly structured
- [ ] Trade direction aligns with higher timeframe trend
- [ ] Enough space till next support/resistance
- [ ] No major news event nearby

---

## Setup Quality
- [ ] Clear support / resistance / structure
- [ ] Entry near the level (not chasing)
- [ ] Stop-loss at **invalidation**, not random
- [ ] Stop-loss is reasonable (not extremely wide)

---

## Risk & Reward
- [ ] 1R (risk) predefined as % of capital
- [ ] Position size calculated from stop-loss
- [ ] 3R target is **logical**, not forced
- [ ] Target not blocked by a strong obstacle

---

## Psychology Check
- [ ] Calm state of mind
- [ ] Fully accept −1R loss
- [ ] Will not widen stop-loss
- [ ] Will wait for SL or target only

---

# 3. BEGINNER-SAFE 2R → 3R TRANSITION PLAN
